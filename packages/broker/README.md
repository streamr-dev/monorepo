# streamr-broker
Broker nodes are Streamr nodes that run externally to your application. You start up a node on a server, and interface with it remotely using one of the supported protocols.

The Broker node ships with plugins for HTTP, Websocket, and MQTT protocols. Libraries for these protocols exist in practically every programming language, meaning that you can conveniently publish and subscribe to data from the Streamr Network using any programming language.

Broker nodes have a plugin architecture that allows them to perform other tasks in addition to (or instead of) serving applications, such as mining.
